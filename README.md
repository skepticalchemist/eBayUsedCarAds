# Probing eBay Kleinanzeigen used car ads 

eBay Kleinanzeigen is a classifieds section of the German eBay website, and the objective here is to do data cleaning and exploration with Pandas.
 
In general, the dataset contains many more unrepaired vehicles than repaired ones, and how one would expect, cars without damage are more expensive. The most expensive brands are Audi, Mercedes Benz, and BMW. Ford and Opel are the less expensive ones. Volkswagen is in between.
